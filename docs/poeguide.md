# POE Authentication Guide for Glossarion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: POE Does Not Use Traditional API Keys

Unlike other AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), **POE requires cookie-based authentication** instead of API keys. This is because POE doesn't offer an official API - we're essentially mimicking a browser session.

### Why Cookie Authentication?

- POE uses **HttpOnly cookies** for security
- These cookies cannot be accessed via JavaScript
- You must manually extract them from your browser
- Cookies expire periodically and need to be refreshed

## üìã How to Get Your POE Cookie

### Detailed Instructions

1. **Login First**: You MUST be logged into poe.com before attempting to get the cookie
2. **Find the Right Cookie**: Look for `p-b` - ignore other cookies like `p-lat`
3. **Copy the Value Only**: Don't copy the cookie name, just its value
4. **Format Correctly**: In Glossarion's API key field, enter it as `p-b:` followed by the value

### Example Format

p-b:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX%3D%3D

## üîÑ Cookie Expiration

POE cookies expire after a few days. When you see authentication errors:

1. Return to poe.com and check if you're still logged in
2. Get a fresh cookie following the steps above
3. Update your API key in Glossarion

## üí° Troubleshooting

| Multiple `p-b` cookies | Use the one with the longest value |
| Authentication fails immediately | Cookie may be expired - get a fresh one |
| Can't find Application/Storage tab | Try right-clicking anywhere ‚Üí Inspect Element |

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why can't I just use an API key like other services?**  
A: POE API key doesn't work for some reason. This integration works by mimicking a browser session, which requires authentication cookies.

**Q: How often do I need to update the cookie?**  
A: Typically every 3-7 days, or whenever you see authentication errors.

**Q: Is this safe?**  
A: I hope, please treat your cookie like a password. Anyone with your cookie can access your POE account.

**Q: Can this be automated?**  
A: Not that i know of. POE uses HttpOnly cookies specifically to prevent programmatic access for security reasons.
