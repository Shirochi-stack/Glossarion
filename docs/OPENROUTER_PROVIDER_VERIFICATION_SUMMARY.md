# OpenRouter Provider Verification - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced logging has been added to definitively verify which provider OpenRouter actually uses for requests, addressing the need to confirm provider selection is working correctly.

## Verification Features Added

### 1. Request Logging
**When**: Before sending request to OpenRouter  
**Where**: `unified_api_client.py` lines ~8606-8615 (SDK) and ~8866-8875 (HTTP)

**Output**:
```
üîÄ OpenRouter: Requesting DeepInfra provider
```

This confirms that Glossarion is sending the provider preference in the request.

---

### 2. Response Header Logging (HTTP Mode)
**When**: After receiving response from OpenRouter (HTTP-only mode)  
**Where**: `unified_api_client.py` lines ~9007-9027

**Output**:
```
‚úÖ OpenRouter Provider (from header): DeepInfra
üìã OpenRouter Response Model: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free
üÜî OpenRouter Generation ID: gen-abc123xyz
üìä OpenRouter Headers: {'x-or-provider': 'DeepInfra', ...}
```

This provides **definitive proof** of which provider handled the request by extracting:
- `x-or-provider` header: The actual provider that served the request
- `model` field: The model identifier used
- `id` field: Generation ID for support/tracking
- All `x-or-*` headers: Complete OpenRouter metadata

---

### 3. Response Model Logging (SDK Mode)
**When**: After receiving response from OpenRouter (SDK mode)  
**Where**: `unified_api_client.py` lines ~8699-8721

**Output**:
```
‚úÖ OpenRouter Response Model: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free
üìã OpenRouter: Provider info may be in HTTP headers (use HTTP-only mode for full logging)
```

SDK mode has limited access to headers, but still extracts:
- Model information from response object
- Reminder to enable HTTP-only mode for full verification

---

### 4. Fallback Path Logging
**When**: If SDK fails and falls back to HTTP  
**Where**: `unified_api_client.py` lines ~8810-8819

**Output**:
```
‚úÖ OpenRouter Provider (from header, fallback): DeepInfra
üìã OpenRouter Response Model (fallback): deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free
```

Ensures logging works even when SDK encounters errors.

---

### 5. Debug Config Persistence
**When**: When SAVE_PAYLOAD is enabled  
**Where**: `unified_api_client.py` lines ~8913-8919

**Saved to**: `openrouter_configs/*.json`

**Content**:
```json
{
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-05T15:26:29",
  "model": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free",
  "preferred_provider": "DeepInfra",
  "safety_disabled": false,
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "max_tokens": 4096
}
```

Provides historical record of what was requested.

---

## HTTP Headers Used for Verification

OpenRouter includes provider information in response headers:

| Header | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `x-or-provider` | Actual provider that handled request | `DeepInfra` |
| `x-or-generation-id` | Unique ID for this generation | `gen-abc123xyz` |
| `x-or-model-id` | Model identifier | `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free` |

These headers are only accessible in **HTTP-only mode**.

---

## Verification Workflow

### For Users
1. **Set provider preference** in Other Settings ‚Üí "DeepInfra"
2. **Enable HTTP-only mode** (recommended for verification)
3. **Run translation**
4. **Check console output** for provider confirmation

### Example Success Flow
```
üîÄ OpenRouter: Requesting DeepInfra provider
[... translation happens ...]
‚úÖ OpenRouter Provider (from header): DeepInfra
üìã OpenRouter Response Model: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free
```
**Conclusion**: ‚úÖ Provider successfully changed to DeepInfra

### Example Fallback Flow
```
üîÄ OpenRouter: Requesting DeepInfra provider
[... translation happens ...]
‚úÖ OpenRouter Provider (from header): OpenInference
```
**Conclusion**: ‚ö†Ô∏è DeepInfra unavailable, fell back to OpenInference

## Technical Implementation Details

### Code Locations

| Feature | File | Line Range | Path Type |
|---------|------|------------|-----------|
| Provider request (SDK) | `unified_api_client.py` | 8606-8615 | SDK/OpenAI |
| Provider request (HTTP) | `unified_api_client.py` | 8866-8875 | Direct HTTP |
| Provider request (Fallback) | `unified_api_client.py` | 8782-8790 | HTTP Fallback |
| Response logging (SDK) | `unified_api_client.py` | 8699-8721 | SDK/OpenAI |
| Response logging (HTTP) | `unified_api_client.py` | 9007-9027 | Direct HTTP |
| Response logging (Fallback) | `unified_api_client.py` | 8810-8819 | HTTP Fallback |
| Config persistence | `unified_api_client.py` | 8913-8919 | Both |

### Exception Handling
All logging is wrapped in try-except blocks to ensure:
- Logging failures don't break API calls
- Graceful degradation if headers missing
- No user-facing errors from logging issues

### Silent Failures
Logging uses `pass` for exceptions to avoid:
- Cluttering error logs with non-critical issues
- Breaking translation flow
- Confusing users with logging-related errors

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Basic Provider Selection
1. Set provider to "DeepInfra"
2. Enable HTTP-only mode
3. Translate a chapter
4. Verify console shows `‚úÖ OpenRouter Provider (from header): DeepInfra`

### Test 2: Provider Fallback
1. Set provider to a less common option (e.g., "Lepton")
2. Enable HTTP-only mode
3. Translate a chapter
4. Check if provider matches or falls back

### Test 3: Auto Mode
1. Set provider to "Auto"
2. Enable HTTP-only mode
3. Translate a chapter
4. Note which provider OpenRouter automatically chose

### Test 4: SDK vs HTTP Mode
1. Test with HTTP-only mode **disabled** (SDK mode)
2. Test with HTTP-only mode **enabled** (HTTP mode)
3. Compare logging detail between modes

---

## Limitations

### SDK Mode Limitations
- Cannot access response headers directly
- Limited provider verification
- Relies on model field inference
- **Recommendation**: Use HTTP-only mode for verification

### Header Availability
- Headers depend on OpenRouter including them
- May vary by model or plan
- Always check if headers exist before accessing

### Provider Fallback
- OpenRouter may ignore provider preference if unavailable
- No error is returned, just different provider used
- Must check logs to detect fallback

---

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly which provider is used
2. **Debugging**: Helps diagnose censorship or availability issues
3. **Verification**: Confirms provider selection is working
4. **Support**: Generation IDs help when contacting OpenRouter support
5. **Historical Record**: Saved configs provide audit trail

---

## Related GitHub Issue

**Issue #36**: "Allow choosing a specific provider on openrouter"
- **Reporter**: oogaboogaw
- **Problem**: Open Inference provider is heavily censored
- **Solution**: Allow specifying DeepInfra to avoid censorship
- **Verification**: These logging features confirm the solution works

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **GUI Display**: Show provider in translation progress dialog
2. **Statistics**: Track which providers are used over time
3. **Provider Health**: Monitor and report provider availability
4. **Automatic Retry**: If preferred provider fails, retry with different provider
5. **Provider Ranking**: Allow specifying multiple providers in order of preference
6. **Cost Tracking**: Different providers may have different costs
