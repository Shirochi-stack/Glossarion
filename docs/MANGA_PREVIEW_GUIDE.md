   - Boxes marked for inpainting exclusion are automatically skipped
   - Inpainting iterations can be configured for optimal results

3. **Recognize Text**
   - Performs OCR on detected text regions
   - Extracts original text for translation
   - Results stored for the translation step

4. **Translate**
   - Translates recognized text to target language
   - Renders translated text onto cleaned image
   - Result appears in "Translated Output" tab

## Working with Detection Boxes

### Automatic Detection

- Box colors indicate different classifications

### Right-Click Context Menu
**Important**: After running "Recognize Text" or "Translate", you can right-click on any detection box to access various editing options:

1. **Edit OCR Results**
   - Right-click any detection box after text recognition
   - Select "üìù Edit OCR: "[preview text]"" from the context menu
   - Opens an editable dialog showing the recognized text
   - Make corrections to fix OCR errors
   - **Save button is required** to update the overlay with changes

2. **Edit Translation Results**
   - Right-click any detection box after translation
   - Select "üåç Edit Translation: "[preview text]"" from the context menu
   - Opens a dialog with both original and translated text
   - Edit either the original text or the translation
   - **Save button is required** to update the overlay with changes
   - Text overlays update immediately after saving

3. **Clean This Text**
   - Right-click any detection box
   - Select "üßπ Clean this text" to apply targeted cleaning
   - Removes text content from the selected region only
   - Useful for spot-cleaning specific problematic areas

4. **OCR This Text**
   - Right-click any detection box
   - Select "üëÅ OCR this text" to perform text recognition on this box only
   - Processes just the selected region instead of all detected text
   - Helpful for re-processing individual boxes with poor recognition

5. **Translate This Text**
   - Right-click any detection box (after OCR)
   - Select "üåç Translate this text" to translate just this box
   - Processes individual text regions independently
   - Allows selective translation of specific content

6. **Inpainting Exclusion**
   - Right-click any detection box
   - Select "üö´ Exclude from inpainting" to protect this region during cleaning
   - Excluded boxes will not be processed during the Clean step
   - Useful for preserving important visual elements or text you want to keep
   - Toggle option - can be enabled/disabled per box

### Manual Editing
When manual editing is enabled:

1. **Creating New Boxes**
   - Select Box Drawing tool (‚ó≠)
   - Click and drag to create rectangle
   - Minimum size required (10x10 pixels)

2. **Selecting Boxes**
   - Use Pan tool (‚úÖ) 
   - Click on any box to select it
   - Selected box turns yellow with thicker border

3. **Moving Boxes**
   - Selected boxes can be dragged to new positions
   - Hover cursor changes to indicate moveable state

4. **Deleting Boxes**
   - Select box first (click on it)
   - Click Delete Selected (üóë) button
   - Or use Clear Boxes (‚ùå) to remove all

### Box Persistence & Auto-Save
- Manual boxes are automatically saved per image
- Position and editing state auto-saved continuously
- Restored when switching between images
- Survives application restarts
- **Auto-save replaces manual "save position" functionality**

### Incremental Editing Support
- All editing operations support incremental updates
- Changes are applied progressively without losing previous work
- OCR and translation results can be refined iteratively
- Context menu operations work on individual boxes for precise control
