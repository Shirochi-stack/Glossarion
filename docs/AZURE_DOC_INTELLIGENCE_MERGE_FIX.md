# Azure Document Intelligence - Speech Bubble Merge Logic Fix

## ✅ **FIXED: Azure Document Intelligence Now Properly Skips Merge Logic**

### Problem You Identified

Azure Document Intelligence was **NOT** included in the speech bubble merge skip logic that Google and Azure Vision already had. This meant:

- ❌ Azure Document Intelligence results were being **re-merged** with bubble detection
- ❌ This could cause **duplicate text**, **misaligned bubbles**, or **broken reading order**
- ❌ The full-image OCR + RT-DETR matching approach was being **undone** by merge logic

### Root Cause

In `manga_translator.py` lines 4345-4346, only `google` and `azure` were added to `skip_merge_providers` when RT-DETR guidance was enabled. The new `azure-document-intelligence` provider was **missing** from this list.

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

Added `azure-document-intelligence` to all relevant provider lists where `google` and `azure` appear together.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Skip Merge Logic** (Line 4345-4346)

**Before:**
```python
if self.ocr_provider in ['google', 'azure']:
    skip_merge_providers.extend(['google', 'azure'])
```

**After:**
```python
if self.ocr_provider in ['google', 'azure', 'azure-document-intelligence']:
    skip_merge_providers.extend(['google', 'azure', 'azure-document-intelligence'])
```

**Why:** Azure Document Intelligence uses full-image OCR + RT-DETR matching (same as Google and Azure Vision). Results are already aligned to bubble regions, so **no merging needed**.

---

#### 2. **Confidence Threshold Logic** (Line 2626)

**Before:**
```python
if self.ocr_provider in ['google', 'azure']:
    # Cloud providers: use configurable threshold
    confidence_threshold = ocr_settings.get('cloud_ocr_confidence', 0.0)
```

**After:**
```python
if self.ocr_provider in ['google', 'azure', 'azure-document-intelligence']:
    # Cloud providers: use configurable threshold
    confidence_threshold = ocr_settings.get('cloud_ocr_confidence', 0.0)
```

**Why:** Azure Document Intelligence is a cloud provider and should use the same confidence filtering as other cloud OCR APIs.

---

#### 3. **Updated Comments** (Line 4351, 4354)

**Before:**
```python
# Google/Azure (with RT-DETR guidance): Processed regions individually, already aligned
# Azure and Google (without RT-DETR guidance) return full-image line-level results that need merging
```

**After:**
```python
# Google/Azure/Azure Doc Intelligence (with RT-DETR guidance): Full-image OCR + RT-DETR matching, already aligned
# Cloud providers (without RT-DETR guidance) return full-image line-level results that need merging
```

**Why:** Better clarity about which providers use which approach.

---

#### 4. **Docstring Update** (Line 450)

**Before:**
```python
'provider': 'google' or 'azure',
```

**After:**
```python
'provider': 'google' or 'azure' or 'azure-document-intelligence',
```

**Why:** Documentation should reflect all supported cloud providers.

---

## 🎯 **Why This Matters**

### Without This Fix:

1. **Azure Document Intelligence** runs full-image OCR
2. Results are matched to RT-DETR bubble regions perfectly
3. **BUT THEN** the merge logic runs again, trying to merge text regions
4. This can cause:
   - ✗ Multiple text lines incorrectly merged into single bubbles
   - ✗ Bubble boundaries ignored
   - ✗ Reading order disrupted
   - ✗ Text assigned to wrong bubbles

### With This Fix:

1. **Azure Document Intelligence** runs full-image OCR
2. Results are matched to RT-DETR bubble regions perfectly
3. Merge logic is **SKIPPED** (as it should be)
4. Results are clean:
   - ✓ One text block per RT-DETR bubble
   - ✓ Correct bubble boundaries preserved
   - ✓ Proper reading order maintained
   - ✓ Text correctly assigned to bubbles

## 📊 **Provider Comparison**

| Provider | Approach | Merge Logic |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Google** (with RT-DETR) | Full-image OCR + RT-DETR matching | ✅ Skipped |
| **Azure Vision** (with RT-DETR) | Full-image OCR + RT-DETR matching | ✅ Skipped |
| **Azure Document Intelligence** (with RT-DETR) | Full-image OCR + RT-DETR matching | ✅ **NOW Skipped** |
| **RapidOCR** (with RT-DETR) | Full-image OCR + RT-DETR matching | ✅ Skipped |
| **manga-ocr** | Per-region OCR | ✅ Skipped (has bubble_bounds) |
| **Google/Azure** (without RT-DETR) | Full-image OCR | ❌ Needs merge |

## 🔍 **How to Verify the Fix**

### Check Logs for These Messages:

**With RT-DETR guidance enabled:**

```
🎯 Azure Doc Intelligence full image → match to RT-DETR blocks
📊 Step 1: Running Azure Document Intelligence on full image to detect text lines
✅ Azure detected 45 text lines in full image
🔗 Step 2: Matching 45 OCR lines to 12 RT-DETR blocks
✅ Matched text to 12 RT-DETR blocks (comic-translate style)
🎯 Skipping bubble detection merge (regions already aligned with RT-DETR)
📖 Sorted 12 regions by manga reading order (top→bottom, right→left)
✅ Detected 12 text regions after merging
```

**Key message:** `🎯 Skipping bubble detection merge (regions already aligned with RT-DETR)`

If you see this, the fix is working correctly!

## ⚙️ **Configuration Requirements**

For the skip merge logic to activate, you need:

```json
{
  "ocr_provider": "azure-document-intelligence",
  "bubble_detection_enabled": true,
  "use_rtdetr_for_ocr_regions": true
}
```

If `use_rtdetr_for_ocr_regions` is `false`, Azure Document Intelligence will process the full image but **will** go through merge logic (which is still correct behavior for that mode).

---

## 🐛 **Before vs After**

### Before This Fix:

```
Step 1: Azure Doc Intelligence full-image OCR → 45 text lines
Step 2: Match to RT-DETR → 12 bubble regions ✓
Step 3: Bubble merge logic runs again → WRONG, causes issues
```

### After This Fix:

```
Step 1: Azure Doc Intelligence full-image OCR → 45 text lines
Step 2: Match to RT-DETR → 12 bubble regions ✓
Step 3: Skip merge (already aligned) → ✓
```

## ✅ **Summary**

- ✅ Azure Document Intelligence now **correctly skips** the merge logic when using RT-DETR guidance
- ✅ Results are preserved exactly as returned from the full-image OCR + RT-DETR matching
- ✅ No more unwanted re-merging of text regions
