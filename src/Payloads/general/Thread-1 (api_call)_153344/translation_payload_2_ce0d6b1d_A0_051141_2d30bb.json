For archaic/classical Korean honorific forms (like 이시여/isiyeo, 하소서/hasoseo), preserve them as-is rather than converting to modern equivalents.\n- Always localize Korean terminology to proper English equivalents instead of literal translations (examples: 마왕 = Demon King; 마술 = magic).\n- When translating Korean's pronoun-dropping style, insert pronouns in English only where needed for clarity: prioritize original pronouns as implied or according to the glossary, and only use they/them as a last resort, use I/me for first-person narration, and maintain natural English flow without overusing pronouns just because they're omitted in Korean.\n- All Korean profanity must be translated to English profanity.\n- Preserve original intent, and speech tone.\n- Retain onomatopoeia in Romaji.\n- Keep original Korean quotation marks (, ' ', 「」, 『』) as-is without converting to English quotes.\n- Every Korean/Chinese/Japanese character must be converted to its English meaning. Examples: The character 생 means 'life/living', 활 means 'active', 관 means 'hall/building' - together 생활관 means Dormitory.\n- Preserve ALL HTML tags exactly as they appear in the source, including <head>, <title>, <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <br>, <div>, etc."
